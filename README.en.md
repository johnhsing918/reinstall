This is a **system reinstall script with a safety confirmation module**, modified from [bin456789/reinstall](https://github.com/bin456789/reinstall).  
Before execution, it requires the user to type **`YES`** to proceed, to prevent accidental operations.

  Running it may cause your server’s **system to be reinstalled and disk data erased**.
